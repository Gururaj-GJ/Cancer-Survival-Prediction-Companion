## üéØ Project Overview

Cancer Survival Prediction Companion is a web application that blends machine learning predictions with empathetic guidance to support informed, human-centered decision-making.

### Mission Statement
To provide accurate, compassionate survival predictions while upholding dignity and supporting thoughtful healthcare conversations.

### Key Objectives
- Deliver clinically relevant survival predictions
- Provide compassionate, supportive guidance
- Empower patients and families with knowledge
- Support healthcare providers in patient communication
- Maintain ethical standards in medical AI applications

---

## üîç How It Works

The application uses a Random Forest model trained on cancer patient data to predict 5-year survival based on patient and clinical parameters.

### Input Parameters
1. Age (years)
2. Gender
3. BMI (Body Mass Index)
4. Smoking Status
5. Alcohol Consumption
6. Cancer Type
7. Cancer Stage (I‚ÄìIV)
8. Treatment Type
9. Genetic Markers
10. Comorbidities (count)
11. Treatment Response
12. Follow-up Frequency

### Prediction Process
1. Data Input: Provider enters parameters
2. Preprocessing: Validation and formatting
3. ML Inference: Random Forest classifier
4. Result Interpretation: Binary outcome (0/1)
5. Guidance Generation: Compassionate recommendations

## üìñ A to Z Usage Guide

### For Healthcare Providers
1) Access the app at http://127.0.0.1:5000 and review the disclaimer  
2) Input patient data across Demographics, Health Metrics, Clinical Information, and Treatment Details  
3) Click Predict Survival and review outcome and guidance  
4) Use results to facilitate supportive conversations and share resources

### For Patients & Families
- Statistical Nature: Predictions are estimates, not certainties
- Individual Variation: Every journey is unique
- Professional Guidance: Always consult your healthcare team
- Use Resources: Explore support and quality-of-life guidance

### Form Validation
- All fields required  
- Age: 0‚Äì120  
- BMI: 10‚Äì60  
- Comorbidities: 0‚Äì10  
- Real-time error messages

### Privacy & Security
- No data storage  
- No personal information collected  
- Session-based processing only  
- HIPAA-aware design principles

> Safety Callout ‚Äî Privacy First
> - The tool processes data locally in-session  
> - Avoid entering personally identifiable information
