## üéØ Project Overview
Cancer Survival Prediction Companion is a compassionate web application designed to assist healthcare providers and patients in understanding cancer survival predictions based on clinical parameters. The tool combines machine learning predictions with empathetic guidance, focusing on improving quality of life and informed decision-making.

### Mission Statement
To provide accurate, compassionate cancer survival predictions while maintaining human dignity and supporting informed healthcare decisions.

### Key Objectives
- Deliver clinically relevant survival predictions
- Provide compassionate, supportive guidance
- Empower patients and families with knowledge
- Support healthcare providers in patient communication
- Maintain ethical standards in medical AI applications

## üîç How It Works
The application uses a Random Forest machine learning model trained on comprehensive cancer patient data to predict 5-year survival outcomes based on:

### Input Parameters
1. **Age**: Patient's age at diagnosis
2. **Gender**: Male/Female
3. **BMI**: Body Mass Index
4. **Smoking Status**: Never/Former/Current
5. **Alcohol Consumption**: None/Low/Moderate/High
6. **Cancer Type**: Lung/Breast/Colorectal/Prostate/Stomach
7. **Cancer Stage**: Stage I/II/III/IV
8. **Treatment Type**: Surgery/Chemotherapy/Radiation/Immunotherapy/Combination
9. **Genetic Markers**: Mutation A/B/C/D/E
10. **Comorbidities**: Number of additional conditions
11. **Treatment Response**: Poor/Moderate/Good
12. **Follow-up Frequency**: Monthly/Quarterly/Biannual/Annual

### Prediction Process
1. **Data Input**: Healthcare provider enters patient parameters
2. **Preprocessing**: Input validation and formatting
3. **ML Inference**: Random Forest model processes data
4. **Result Interpretation**: Binary outcome (0: Not Surviving, 1: Surviving)
5. **Guidance Generation**: Compassionate recommendations and resources

   ```bash
   pip install scikit-learn pandas numpy
   ```

2. **Model training** (optional)
   ```python
   # Train new model with updated data
   python train_model.py
   ```

## üìñ A to Z Usage Guide
### Step 1: Access the Application
- Open `index.html` in your browser
- Ensure JavaScript is enabled

### Step 2: Enter Patient Information
#### Basic Information
- **Age**: Enter numerical age (1-120)
- **Gender**: Select from dropdown
- **BMI**: Enter Body Mass Index (10-50)

#### Lifestyle Factors
- **Smoking Status**: Select appropriate category
- **Alcohol Consumption**: Select consumption level

#### Medical Information
- **Cancer Type**: Choose primary cancer type
- **Cancer Stage**: Select disease progression stage
- **Treatment Type**: Specify current treatment approach

#### Clinical Markers
- **Genetic Markers**: Select relevant genetic mutation
