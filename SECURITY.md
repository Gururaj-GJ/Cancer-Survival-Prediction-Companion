# Security Policy

## 🔒 Overview

The Cancer Survival Prediction Companion is an **educational tool** designed with privacy and security as core principles. This document outlines our security approach and how to report vulnerabilities.

## 🎯 Security Philosophy

### Privacy by Design

✅ **What We DO:**
- Run 100% offline (no internet connectivity required)
- Process all data locally in the browser
- Store NO personal health information (PHI)
- Transmit NO data to external servers
- Use NO cookies or tracking
- Collect NO analytics or telemetry

❌ **What We DON'T Do:**
- Store user data
- Transmit health information
- Track user behavior
- Collect identifiable information
- Require user accounts
- Access external databases

## 🛡️ Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## 🚨 Reporting a Vulnerability

### What Qualifies as a Security Issue?

**Please Report:**
- Data leakage vulnerabilities
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities
- Code injection possibilities
- Accessibility bypasses affecting disclaimers
- Misleading UI that could confuse medical warnings
- Dependencies with known CVEs
- Privacy violations

**Not Security Issues (but welcome as regular issues):**
- Feature requests
- UI/UX suggestions
- Performance optimizations
- Documentation improvements

### How to Report

**For Security Vulnerabilities:**

1. **Email**: gururaj.gj.guru@gmail.com
   - Subject: "SECURITY: Cancer Survival Prediction Companion"
   - Include detailed description
   - Provide steps to reproduce
   - Attach screenshots if applicable

2. **Do NOT**:
   - Open public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities
   - Disclose publicly before we've addressed it
   - Test vulnerabilities on production deployments

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 7 days
- **Fix Timeline**: Depends on severity
  - Critical: 1-7 days
  - High: 7-30 days
  - Medium: 30-90 days
  - Low: Next release cycle

### What to Expect

1. **Acknowledgment**: We'll confirm receipt of your report
2. **Assessment**: We'll evaluate the severity and validity
3. **Resolution**: We'll develop and test a fix
4. **Disclosure**: We'll coordinate public disclosure with you
5. **Credit**: We'll acknowledge your contribution (if desired)

## 🔐 Security Best Practices for Users

### For Healthcare Providers

- **DO NOT** enter actual patient identifiable information
- Use for educational/demonstration purposes only
- Always consult clinical guidelines and protocols
- Maintain professional medical judgment
- Follow your institution's IT security policies

### For Patients and Families

- This tool does NOT replace medical advice
- Discuss results with qualified healthcare providers
- Do not make treatment decisions based solely on this tool
- Understand this is an educational demonstration

### For Developers/Contributors

- Keep dependencies updated
- Review code for XSS vulnerabilities
- Maintain offline-first architecture
- Never add features requiring data transmission
- Test with security-focused mindset
- Follow secure coding practices

## 🕵️ Security Considerations

### Data Handling

- **All computation**: Client-side JavaScript
- **No storage**: Data cleared on page refresh
- **No transmission**: Zero network calls for core functionality
- **No logs**: No server-side logging (because there's no server)

### Browser Security

- Relies on browser's built-in security sandbox
- No eval() or Function() constructor usage
- Content Security Policy compatible
- Safe from common web vulnerabilities (CSRF, SQL injection) due to offline nature

### Dependencies

- Minimal external dependencies
- Regularly updated for security patches
- Vetted for supply chain security
- Self-contained when possible

## ⚠️ Limitations and Disclaimers

### Not a Medical Device

- **No FDA approval or clearance**
- **Not clinically validated**
- **Not intended for clinical use**
- **Educational demonstration only**

### Security Scope

 This tool cannot protect against:
- Physical access to the device
- Screen recording or screenshots
- Browser vulnerabilities
- Operating system compromises
- Social engineering attacks

### Compliance

- **HIPAA**: N/A (no PHI stored or transmitted)
- **GDPR**: N/A (no personal data collected)
- **FDA**: Not a medical device
- **ISO 13485**: Not applicable
